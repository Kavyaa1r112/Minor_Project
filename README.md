# Minor_Project
The Project focuses on the influence that social media is having on the corporate landscape and how social media management influences brand awareness and brand reputation. This system
aims to provide an all-in-one platform for social media management across multiple sites. The
system can post across all the platforms with a single click. It will track the posts for social media engagement metrics. It will do the trend and Sentiment analysis of the posts to provide a detailed description of how well the posts are doing. It will also do automated reputation management by suggesting improvements in the content and automated removal of posts which are receiving
negative feedback.
